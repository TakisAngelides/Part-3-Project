# Part-3-Project

This is my code for my Part III project at Cavendish, University of Cambridge. The code has been written solely by me, Takis Angelides, with no other contributors.

This code is not be used in any way without the author's permission and has been made public only for the purpose of examiners reading the code.

The titles of each file correspond to each case in the project's paper.

non_collision_one_massive : at least one of p and q is massive

non_collision_massless : both p and q are massless

non_collision_zeros : p = q = 0.
