# Part-3-Project

This is my code for my Part III project at Cavendish, University of Cambridge.

The titles of each file correspond to each case in the project's paper.

non_collision_one_massive : at least one of p and q is massive

non_collision_massless : both p and q are massless

non_collision_zeros : p = q = 0.
